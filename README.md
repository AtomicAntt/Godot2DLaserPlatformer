# Building and Running the game

First, install the Godot game engine (3.5.3) [here](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.5.3-stable/)

Make sure to download the .NET and not the Standard!

git clone https://github.com/AtomicAntt/Godot2DLaserPlatformer
```

Finally, open up the Godot Engine project manager, click the Import button, and choose the 'project.godot' file from the files downloaded.
